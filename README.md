## minimal xkcd viewer **with read tracking**.


## Cold Open

After years of using the "random" button, I realized I've lost track of which comics I have and haven't read. While a random comic I would likely have seen before, I knew there were still many comics I haven't seen.

Mathematically, this predicament is the [occupancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupancy_problem) or [coupon collector's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem) problem. To see every comic, I can expect to click the "random" button far more (26700) than the actual number of comics (3100).

It's much more efficient to track the comics I have and haven't read. Sure, I could read the comics in order. But I also enjoy the freedom to read comics at will, in no particular order.

After experimenting with existing options, I bit the bullet and made my own xkcd viewer. I know there are other XKCD browsers (unixkcd, xkcd.wtf, [etc](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Browser_helpers), [etc](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/explain_xkcd:Community_portal/Admin_requests#XKCD_Browser)), but surprisingly none of them tackles tracking read progress (to my knowledge).
