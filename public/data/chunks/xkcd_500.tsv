533	Laptop Hell	laptop_hell.png	The xkcd.com sysadmin has a Q2010, and I can attest that it can handle a fall down several flight of concrete steps.  Relatedly, he's upset with me -- I hope he doesn't take revenge by messing with my site's contenDISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS			2009	1	21

556	Alternative Energy Revolution	alternative_energy_revolution.jpg	The moment their arms spun freely in our air, they were doomed -- for Man has earned his right to hold this planet against all comers, by virtue of occasionally producing someone totally batshit insane.			2009	3	16
557	Students	students.png	The same goes for the one where you're wrestling the Green Ranger in the swimming pool full of Crisco.  You guys all have that dream, right?  It's not just me.  Right?			2009	3	18

561	Well	well.png	I'll concede ergonomics anecdotally, but none of the studies of Dvorak were at all rigorous (the most-cited Navy study was overseen by Dvorak himself).  And the 'slow typists down' thing is a myth.  Also EMACS RULES VI DROOLS WOOOOOOO!			2009	3	27

566	Matrix Revisited	matrix_revisited.png	I actually remember being entertained by both the sequels while in the theater.  They just don't hold up nearly as well in later comparison.			2009	4	8

573	Parental Trolling	parental_trolling.png	They'll pick music and culture that they know annoys you.  Building in behavioral easter eggs is a fair retaliation!			2009	4	24
574	Swine Flu	swine_flu.png	Bad flu epidemics can hit young adults hardest because they provoke their powerful immune systems into overreaction, so to stay healthy spend the next few weeks drunk and sleep-deprived to keep yours suppressed.			2009	4	27
575	Tag Combination	tag_combination.png	I love Eileen / and want you to love her / When you're around / I'm one floor above her / If you could see / just how much I adore her / Oh, that pretty red dress / I'd do anything for her /  (Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ayy)			2009	4	29

579	The Race: Part 3	the_race_part_3.png	No, the best things about The Sarah Connor Chronicles were: (1) watching Sarah and Cameron try to pass for normal, and (2) Cameron throwing people and things through walls.

580	The Race: Part 4	the_race_part_4.png	Things are rarely just crazy enough to work, but they're frequently just crazy enough to fail hilariously.		For this week, xkcd will update once a day (through Friday).	2009	5	7
581	The Race: Part 5	the_race_part_5.png	It was actually canceled because they just noticed he's been naked under that coat the whole time.  There's a petition on Facebook to get Fox to un-cancel it, and one on Livejournal to get him to take off the coat.			2009	5	8

583	CNR	cnr.png	Can't and shouldn't.			2009	5	13

591	Troll Slayer	troll_slayer.png	We have met the enemy and he is us.			2009	6	1
592	Drama	drama.png	This happens in geek circles every so often. The 'Hey, this is just a system I can figure out easily!' is also a problem among engineers first diving into the stock market.			2009	6	3
593	Voynich Manuscript	voynich_manuscript.png	Wait, is that the ORIGINAL voynich manuscript?  Where did you GET that?  Wanna try playing a round of Druids and Dicotyledons?			2009	6	5

595	Android Girlfriend	android_girlfriend.png	Programming the sexbots to enjoy sex seemed a sensible move at the time, but we didn't realize the consequences of their developing fetishes.			2009	6	10

608	Form	form.png	'This space intentionally left blank' is less immediately provocative but more Hofstadterially confusing.			2009	7	10
609	Tab Explosion	tab_explosion.png	Cracked.com is another inexplicable browser narcotic.  They could write a list of '17 worst haircuts in the Ottoman Empire' and I'd read through to the end, then click on all the links at the end.	https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalTropes		2009	7	13

611	Disaster Voyeurism	disaster_voyeurism.png	Hurricane forums are full of excited comments about central pressure and wind speed and comparisons to Camille and 1931 and 1938, with hastily-tacked-on notes about how it will be tragic if anyone dies and they hope it's a dud.			2009	7	17
612	Estimation	estimation.png	They could say "the connection is probably lost," but it's more fun to do naive time-averaging to give you hope that if you wait around for 1,163 hours, it will finally finish.			2009	7	20

617	Understocked	understocked.png	My biology grad student friends tell me that different types of alcohol don't actually have different effects. I trust their expertise, not because of the 'biology' part, but because of the 'grad student'.			2009	7	31

631	Anatomy Text	anatomy_text.png	For many of the anatomy pictures on Wikipedia, I think this is actually not far from reality. They only look all formal and professional due to careful cropping.			2009	9	2
632	Suspicion	suspicion.png	Fine, walk away.  I'm gonna go cry into a pint of Ben&Jerry's Brownie Batter(tm) ice cream [link], then take out my frustration on a variety of great flash games from PopCap Games(r) [link].			2009	9	4
633	Blockbuster Mining	blockbuster_mining.png	The 2007 Bridge to Terebithia trailer put me off too much to see that particular movie, but I am cautiously optimistic about Where the Wild Things Are.			2009	9	7

638	The Search	the_search.png	I am so excited about the Kepler mission. This is the second most important thing our species has ever done, right behind inventing the concept of delivery pizza.			2009	9	18
639	Lincoln-Douglas	lincoln_douglas.png	Stephen Douglas actually died soon after the debates and election, but if you demand historical accuracy in your webcomics you should be reading Hark! A Vagrant.			2009	9	21
640	Tornado Hunter	tornado_hunter.png	The Fujita Scale was replaced by the Enhanced Fujita Scale in 2007, but I think 'EF-5' sounds stupid, so I vote we just use the new measurements for assigning numbers but still call them 'F-whatever'.			2009	9	23

647	Scary	scary.png	I'm teaching every 8-year-old relative to say this, and every 14-year-old to do the same thing with Toy Story.  Also, Pokemon hit the US over a decade ago and kids born after Aladdin came out will turn 18 next year.			2009	10	9

732	HDTV	hdtv.png	We're also stuck with blurry, juddery, slow-panning 24fps movies forever because (thanks to 60fps home video) people associate high framerates with camcorders and cheap sitcoms, and thus think good framerates look 'fake'.			2010	4	26

744	Walkthrough	walkthrough.png	There's nothing hotter than porn dubbed over with a poorly-mic'd teenager's voice explaining each step in a droning monotone. 'okay, we're almost at the spawn point ... separate the labia, but watch out, there are more inside them ..."			2010	5	24
745	Dyslexics	dyslexics.png	And of course I had to redo this like three times because I kept writing 'UNTIE'; I kept doing 'doing 'doing it wrong' wrong' wrong.			2010	5	26

748	Worst-Case Scenario	worst_case_scenario.png	To get serious analyses of hurricanes and oil slicks, see Jeff Masters' blog. To get serious discussions of worst-case scenario thinking, see Bruce Schneier's blog. To get enough Vitamin D, don't read any blogs and go outside instead.			2010	6	2

753	Southern Half	southern_half.png	Also, if you read his speech at Rice, all his arguments for going to the moon work equally well as arguments for blowing up the moon, sending cloned dinosaurs into space, or constructing a towering penis-shaped obelisk on Mars.			2010	6	14

756	Public Opinion	public_opinion.png	News networks giving a greater voice to viewers because the social web is so popular are like a chef on the Titanic who, seeing the looming iceberg and fleeing customers, figures ice is the future and starts making snow cones.			2010	6	21

759	3x9	3x9.png	Handy exam trick: when you know the answer but not the correct derivation, derive blindly forward from the givens and backward from the answer, and join the chains once the equations start looking similar. Sometimes the graders don't notice the seam.			2010	6	28

764	One Two	one_two.png	Cue letters from anthropology majors complaining that this view of numerolinguistic development perpetuates a widespread myth. They get to write letters like that because when you're not getting a real science degree you have a lot of free time. Zing!			2010	7	9
765	Dilution	dilution.png	Dear editors of Homeopathy Monthly: I have two small corrections for your July issue.  One, it's spelled "echinacea", and two, homeopathic medicines are no better than placebos and your entire magazine is a sham.			2010	7	12

768	1996	1996.png	College Board issues aside, I have fond memories of TI-BASIC, writing in it a 3D graphing engine and a stock market analyzer. With enough patience, I could make anything ... but friends. (Although with my chatterbot experiments, I certainly tried.)			2010	7	19
769	War	war.png	They offered to make me a green beret, but I liked my regular one. Although it gets kind of squashed under my helmet.			2010	7	21

773	University Website	university_website.png	People go to the website because they can't wait for the next alumni magazine, right? What do you mean, you want a campus map? One of our students made one as a CS class project back in '01!  You can click to zoom and everything!			2010	7	30
774	Atheists	atheists.png	'But you're using that same tactic to try to feel superior to me, too!' 'Sorry, that accusation expires after one use per conversation.'			2010	8	2

777	Pore Strips	pore_strips.png	I'm sure they're a harmful tool of the cosmetics-industrial complex and all, but my goodness do those strips ever work to pull gunk out of your pores. I was shocked, disgusted, and vaguely fascinated by the result.			2010	8	9

780	Sample	sample.png	There are two or three songs out there with beeps in the chorus that sound exactly like the clock radio alarm I had in high school, and hearing it makes me think my life since junior year has been a dream I'm about to wake up from.			2010	8	16
781	Ahead Stop	ahead_stop.png	They actually started the reversed-text practice in 1977 -- not for ease-of-reading reasons, but because too many people were driving backward down the highway blasting the Star Wars opening theme.			2010	8	18

783	I Don't Want Directions	i_dont_want_directions.png	Yes, I understand that the turn is half a mile past the big field, but my GPS knows that, too.  This would be easier if you weren't about to ask me to repeat it all back to you.			2010	8	23

800	Beautiful Dream	beautiful_dream.png	Lucky. In MY dream, all the people who grew up loving The Giving Tree paired up with all the students who had weird dreams after reading The Metamorphosis. That one was more confusing.			2010	10	1

831	Weather Radar	weather_radar.png	Ever notice how there aren't as many thunderstorms now as there were when you were a kid?  Much like 'the shuffle on my MP3 player has a bias', this is occasionally true but universally believed. Brains are so interesting!			2010	12	8

862	Let Go	let_go.png	After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once).

870	Advertising	mathematically_annoying.png	I remember the exact moment in my childhood when I realized, while reading a flyer, that nobody would ever spend money solely to tell me they wanted to give me something for nothing.

878	Model Rail	model_rail.png	I don't know what's more telling--the number of pages in the Wikipedia talk page argument over whether the 1/87.0857143 scale is called "HO" or "H0", or the fact that within minutes of first hearing of it I had developed an extremely strong opinion on the issue.			2011	3	28

890	Etymology	etymology.png	For some reason, my childhood suspension of disbelief had no problem with the fact that this ancient galaxy is full of humans, but was derailed by language. There's no Asia OR Europe there, so where'd they get all the Indo-European roots?			2011	4	25
891	Movie Ages	movie_ages.png	If you're 15 or younger, then just remember that it's nevertheless probably too late to be a child prodigy.			2011	4	27
892	Null Hypothesis	null_hypothesis.png	Hell, my eighth grade science class managed to conclusively reject it just based on a classroom experiment. It's pretty sad to hear about million-dollar research teams who can't even manage that.			2011	4	29
