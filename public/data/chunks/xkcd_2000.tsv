2002	LeBron James and Stephen Curry	lebron_james_and_stephen_curry.png	The 538TR attempts to capture a player's combined skill at basketball (either real-life or NBA 2K18) and election forecasting.			2018	6	4
2003	Presidential Succession	presidential_succession.png	Ties are broken by whoever was closest to the surface of Europa when they were born.			2018	6	6
2004	Sun and Earth	sun_and_earth.png	But we don't need to worry about the boiling masses sandwiching the thin layer in which we live, since we're so fragile and short-lived that it's unlikely to kill us before something else does! Wait, why doesn't that sound reassuring?			2018	6	8
2005	Attention Span	attention_span.png	I didn't even realize they MADE a novelization of "Surf Ninjas." How did you-- Oh my god, it's signed by the author?!	https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-repressive-authoritarian-soul-of-thomas-the-tank-engine-and-friends		2018	6	11
2006	Customer Rewards	customer_rewards.png	We'll pay you $1.47 to post on social media about our products, $2.05 to mention it in any group chats you're in, and 11 cents per passenger each time you drive your office carpool past one of our billboards.			2018	6	13
2007	Brookhaven RHIC	brookhaven_rhic.png	"Buddy, you trying to pull something? I can't buy this gold--all the electrons are missing. I could face serious charges!"			2018	6	15
2008	Irony Definition	irony_definition.png	Can you stop glaring at me like that? It makes me feel really ironic.			2018	6	18
2009	Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram	hertzsprung_russell_diagram.png	The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is located in its own lower right corner, unless you're viewing it on an unusually big screen.			2018	6	20
2010	Update Notes	update_notes.png	v3.0.2: Hey, if anyone still using this app is headed to the beach, can you stop at 4th and River St and grab the sunscreen from my car? Trunk should be unlocked. Thanks!			2018	6	22
2011	Newton's Trajectories	newtons_trajectories.png	With just one extra line, he could have anticipated the 2003 film The Core, but some things are too audacious for even the greatest visionaries.			2018	6	25
2012	Thorough Analysis	thorough_analysis.png	The likely shape of the bells was determined through consultation with several bellringing experts at the Tower of London. Transcripts of those interviews are available in Appendix VII.			2018	6	27
2013	Rock	rock.png	It traveled so far to reach me. I owed it my best.			2018	6	29
2014	JWST Delays	jwst_delays.png	Since delays should get less likely closer to the launch, most astronomers in 2018 believed the expansion of the schedule was slowing, but by early 2020 new measurements indicated that it was actually accelerating.			2018	7	2
2015	New Phone Thread	new_phone_thread.png	I'm going to tell the manufacturer that their business practices are ADMIRABLE and ETHICAL and their developers are ATTRACTIVE and I'm going to report them to the FCC for their IMPECCABLE VIRTUE.			2018	7	4
2016	OEIS Submissions	oeis_submissions.png	SUB[59]: The submission numbers for my accepted OEIS submissions in chronological order			2018	7	6
2017	Stargazing 2	stargazing_2.png	I mean, it wasn't exactly MY thesis. When the FAA came to shut down our observatory for using the telescope mirror to shine light at airplanes, I took a thesis and a bunch of doctorates from the supply cabinet on my way out.			2018	7	9
2018	Wall Art	wall_art.png	At first, I moved from pokémon posters to regular oil paintings, but then these really grumpy and unreasonable detectives from the Louvre showed up and took them all. They wouldn't even give me back my thumbtacks!			2018	7	11
2019	An Apple for a Dollar	an_apple_for_a_dollar.png	I'd like 0.4608 apples, please.			2018	7	13
2020	Negative Results	negative_results.png	P.S. We're going to the beach this weekend, so I'm attaching my preregistration forms for that trip now, before we find out whether it produces any interesting results.			2018	7	16
2021	Software Development	software_development.png	Update: It turns out the cannon has a motorized base, and can make holes just fine using the barrel itself as a battering ram. But due to design constraints it won't work without a projectile loaded in, so we still need those drills.			2018	7	18
2022	Sports Champions	sports_champions.png	For a long time, people thought maybe Usain Bolt was the one for running, until the 2090s and the incredible dominance of Derek Legs.			2018	7	20
2023	Y-Axis	y_axis.png	We've also developed the semi-semi-log scale, where the Y-axis for the left half of the graph is a log scale but on the right half it isn't.			2018	7	23
2024	Light Hacks	light_hacks.png	Life hack: Wait for an advanced civilization to be briefly distracted, then sneak in and construct a slightly smaller Dyson sphere inside theirs.			2018	7	25
2025	Peer Review	peer_review.png	Your manuscript "Don't Pay $25 to Access Any of the Articles in this Journal: A Review of Preprint Repositories and Author Willingness to Email PDF Copies for Free" has also been rejected, but nice try.			2018	7	27
2026	Heat Index	heat_index.png	The heat index is calculated via looking up the "effective temperature" in a table of air temperature and humidity values, and then adding a bunch more degrees because it feels WAY hotter than that.			2018	7	30
2027	Lightning Distance	lightning_distance.png	The index of radio refraction does have a lot of variation, which might throw off your calculations, so you can also look at the difference in brightness between the visible flash and more-attenuated UV and x-rays.			2018	8	1
2028	Complex Numbers	complex_numbers.png	I'm trying to prove that mathematics forms a meta-abelian group, which would finally confirm my suspicions that algebraic geometry and geometric algebra are the same thing.			2018	8	3
2029	Disaster Movie	disaster_movie.png	Really, they'd be rushing around collecting revisions to go into the next scheduled quarterly public data update, not publishing them immediately, but you have to embellish things a little for Hollywood.			2018	8	6
2030	Voting Software	voting_software.png	There are lots of very smart people doing fascinating work on cryptographic voting protocols. We should be funding and encouraging them, and doing all our elections with paper ballots until everyone currently working in that field has retired.			2018	8	8
2031	Pie Charts	pie_charts.png	If you can't get your graphing tool to do the shading, just add some clip art of cosmologists discussing the unusual curvature of space in the area.			2018	8	10
2032	Word Puzzles	word_puzzles.png	Eno's storied aria was once soloed by Judge Lance Ito on the alto oboe at Ohio's AirAsia Arena.			2018	8	13
2033	Repair or Replace	repair_or_replace.png	Just make sure all your friends and family are out of the car, or that you've made backup friends and family at home.			2018	8	15
2034	Equations	equations.png	All electromagnetic equations: The same as all fluid dynamics equations, but with the 8 and 23 replaced with the permittivity and permeability of free space, respectively.			2018	8	17
2035	Dark Matter Candidates	dark_matter_candidates.png	My theory is that dark matter is actually just a thin patina of grime covering the whole universe, and we don't notice it because we haven't thoroughly cleaned the place in eons.			2018	8	20
2036	Edgelord	edgelord.png	If you study graphs in which edges can link more than two nodes, you're more properly called a hyperedgelord.			2018	8	22
2037	Supreme Court Bracket	supreme_court_bracket.png	My bracket was busted in the first round; I had Massachusetts v. Connecticut in the final, probably in a case over who gets to annex Rhode Island.			2018	8	24
2038	Hazard Symbol	hazard_symbol.png	The warning diamond on the Materials Safety Data Sheet for this stuff just has the "😰" emoji in all four fields.			2018	8	27
2039	Begging the Question	begging_the_question.png	At least we can all agree on the enormity of this usage.			2018	8	29
2040	Sibling-in-Law	sibling_in_law.png	FYI, it turns out "...because I haven't figured out whether he would be my brother-in-law or not" does NOT qualify as a "reason why these two should not be wed."			2018	8	31
2041	Frontiers	frontiers.png	Star Trek V is a small part of the space frontier, but it's been a while since that movie came out so I assume we've finished exploring it by now.			2018	9	3
2042	Rolle's Theorem	rolles_theorem.png	I mean, if it's that easy to get a theorem named for you ... "a straight line that passes through the center of a coplanar circle always divides the circle into two equal halves." Can I have that one? Wait, can I auction off the naming rights? It can be the Red Bull Theorem or the Quicken Loans Theorem, depending who wants it more.			2018	9	5
2043	Boathouses and Houseboats	boathouses_and_houseboats.png	The <x> that is held by <y> is also a <y><x>, so if you go to a food truck, the stuff you buy is truck food. A phone that's in your car is a carphone, and a car equipped with a phone is a phonecar. When you play a mobile racing game, you're in your phonecar using your carphone to drive a different phonecar. I'm still not sure about bananaphones.			2018	9	7
2044	Sandboxing Cycle	sandboxing_cycle.png	All I want is a secure system where it's easy to do anything I want. Is that so much to ask?			2018	9	10
2045	Social Media Announcement	social_media_announcement.png	Why I'm Moving Most of My Social Activity to Slack, Then Creating a Second Slack to Avoid the People in the First One, Then Giving Up on Social Interaction Completely, Then Going Back to Texting			2018	9	12
2046	Trum-	trum.png	Excited to vote for future presidents Bill Eisenhamper, Amy Forb, Ethan Obample, and Abigail Washingtoast.			2018	9	14
2047	Beverages	beverages.png	If I wait a while, it's not so bad, because then it's just shaped like me, plus some pipes and tanks and probably eventually all of Earth's oceans.			2018	9	17
2048	Curve-Fitting	curve_fitting.png	Cauchy-Lorentz: "Something alarmingly mathematical is happening, and you should probably pause to Google my name and check what field I originally worked in."			2018	9	19
2049	Unfulfilling Toys	unfulfilling_toys.png	We were going to do a falling-apart Rubik's cube that was just 27 independent blocks stuck together with magnets, but then we realized it was actually really cool and even kind of worked, so we cut that one.			2018	9	21
2050	6/6 Time	6_6_time.png	You know how Einstein figured out that the speed of light was constant, and everything else had to change for consistency? My theory is like his, except not smart or good.	https://xkcd.com/1061/		2018	9	24
2051	Bad Opinions	bad_opinions.png	I thought of another bad opinion! I couldn't find anyone who expressed it specifically, but still, the fact that I can so easily imagine it is infuriating! I'm gonna tell everyone about it!			2018	9	26
2052	Stanislav Petrov Day	stanislav_petrov_day.png	I was going to get you an alarm clock that occasionally goes off randomly in the middle of the night, but you can ignore it and go back to sleep and it's fine.			2018	9	28
2053	Incoming Calls	incoming_calls.png	I wonder if that friendly lady ever fixed the problem she was having with her headset.			2018	10	1
2054	Data Pipeline	data_pipeline.png	"Is the pipeline literally running from your laptop?" "Don't be silly, my laptop disconnects far too often to host a service we rely on. It's running on my phone."			2018	10	3
2055	Bluetooth	bluetooth.png	Bluetooth is actually named for the tenth-century Viking king Harald "Bluetooth" Gormsson, but the protocol developed by Harald was a wireless charging standard unrelated to the modern Bluetooth except by name.			2018	10	5
2056	Horror Movies	horror_movies.png	"Isn't the original Jurassic Park your favorite movie of all time?" "Yes, but that's because I like dinosaurs and I WANT there to be an island full of them. If John Hammond's lab had been breeding serial killers in creepy masks, I wouldn't have watched!" "Wait, are you sure? That could actually be good." "Ok, I WOULD watch the scenes where Jeff Goldblum tries to convince a bunch of executives that the park is a bad idea."			2018	10	8
2057	Internal Monologues	internal_monologues.png	Haha, just kidding, everyone's already been hacked. I wonder if today's the day we find out about it.			2018	10	10
2058	Rock Wall	rock_wall.png	I don't trust mantle/core geologists because I suspect that, if they ever get a chance to peel away the Earth's crust, they'll do it in a heartbeat.			2018	10	12
2059	Modified Bayes' Theorem	modified_bayes_theorem.png	Don't forget to add another term for "probability that the Modified Bayes' Theorem is correct."			2018	10	15
2060	Hygrometer	hygrometer.png	I'm working on assembling a combination declinometer, sclerometer, viscometer, aleurometer, stalagmometer, and hypsometer. I'm making good progress according to my ometerometer, a device which shows the rate at which I'm acquiring measurement devices.			2018	10	17
2061	Tectonics Game	tectonics_game.png	They're limiting the playtesters to type A3 V stars, so the games will all end before the Sun consumes the Earth.			2018	10	19
2062	Barnard's Star	barnards_star.png	"Ok, team. We have a little under 10,000 years before closest approach to figure out how to destroy Barnard's Star." "Why, does it pose a threat to the Solar System?" "No. It's just an asshole."			2018	10	22
2063	Carnot Cycle	carnot_cycle.png	The Carnot cycle is more properly known by its full title, the "Carnot-Tolkien-Wagner Ring Cycle."			2018	10	24
2064	I'm a Car	im_a_car.png	I'm the proud parent of an honor student, and the person driving me is proud, too!			2018	10	26
2065	Who Sends the First Text?	who_sends_the_first_text.png	I sort of wish my texting app showed the percentage next to each person, but also sort of don't want to know.			2018	10	29
2066	Ballot Selfies	ballot_selfies.png	There were actually some good reasons for those laws, but IMO they now do more harm than good. Which raises a question: If there's a ballot measure to strike them down, how can I resist the urge to take a picture of my "yes" vote?			2018	10	31
2067	Challengers	challengers.png	Use your mouse or fingers to pan + zoom. To edit the map, submit your ballot on November 6th.			2018	11	2
2068	Election Night	election_night.png	"Even the blind—those who are anxious to hear, but are not able to see—will be taken care of. Immense megaphones have been constructed and will be in use at The Tribune office and in the Coliseum. The one at the Coliseum will be operated by a gentleman who draws $60 a week from Barnum & Bailey's circus for the use of his voice."			2018	11	5
2069	Wishlist	wishlist.png	Disappointed that they caved to fan pressure and went with Ruth Bader Ginsburg over Elena Kagan.			2018	11	7
2070	Trig Identities	trig_identities.png	ARCTANGENT THETA = ENCHANT AT TARGET			2018	11	9
2071	Indirect Detection	indirect_detection.png	I'm like a prisoner in Plato's Cave, seeing only the shade you throw on the wall.			2018	11	12
2072	Evaluating Tech Things	evaluating_tech_things.png	Also known as the Black Mirror-Mythbusters scale.			2018	11	14
2073	Kilogram	kilogram.png	I'm glad to hear they're finally redefining the meter to be exactly three feet.			2018	11	16
2074	Airplanes and Spaceships	airplanes_and_spaceships.png	Despite having now taken three months longer than the airplane people, we're making disappointingly little progress toward the obvious next stage of vehicle: The Unobtanium-hulled tunneling ship from the 2003 film 'The Core.'			2018	11	19
2075	Update Your Address	update_your_address.png	This is my four-digit PIN. It was passed down to me by my father, and someday I will pass it on to you. Unless we figure out how to update it, but that sounds complicated.			2018	11	21
2076	Horror Movies 2	horror_movies_2.png	When I was a kid, someone told me the end of The Giver was ambiguous, which surprised me. I had just assumed Jonah died--because the book had a medal on the cover, and I knew grown-ups liked stories where sad stuff happens at the end for no reason.			2018	11	23
2077	Heist	heist.png	But he has a hat AND a toolbox! Where could someone planning a heist get THOSE?			2018	11	26
2078	Popper	popper.png	At least, I don't think there's evidence. My claim that there's no evidence hasn't been falsified. At least, not that I know of.			2018	11	28
2079	Alpha Centauri	alpha_centauri.png	And let's be honest, it's more like two and a half stars. Proxima is barely a star and barely bound to the system.			2018	11	30
2080	Cohort and Age Effects	cohort_and_age_effects.png	Younger people get very few joint replacements, yet they're also getting more than older people did at the same age. This means you can choose between 'Why are millennials getting so (many/few) joint replacements?' depending on which trend fits your current argument better.			2018	12	3
2081	Middle Latitudes	middle_latitudes.png	Snowy blizzards are fun, but so are warm sunny beaches, so we split the difference by having lots of icy wet slush!			2018	12	5
2082	Mercator Projection	mercator_projection.png	The other great lakes are just water on the far side of Canada Island. If you drive north from the Pacific northwest you actually cross directly into Alaska, although a few officials--confused by the Mercator distortion--have put up border signs.			2018	12	7
2083	Laptop Issues	laptop_issues.png	Hang on, we got a call from the feds. They say we can do whatever with him, but the EPA doesn't want that laptop in the ocean. They're sending a team.			2018	12	10
2084	FDR	fdr.png	June 21st, 365, the date of the big Mediterranean earthquake and tsunami, lived in infamy for a few centuries before fading. Maybe the trick is a catchy rhyme; the '5th of November' thing is still going strong over 400 years later.			2018	12	12
2085	arXiv	arxiv.png	Both arXiv and archive.org are invaluable projects which, if they didn't exist, we would dismiss as obviously ridiculous and unworkable.			2018	12	14
2086	History Department	history_department.png	When we take into account the recent discovery of previously-unstudied history in the 1750s, this year may have been an outright loss.			2018	12	17
2087	Rocket Launch	rocket_launch.png	NASA tries to coordinate launch timing with the Care Bears' cloud castle, but unfortunately sometimes collisions with stray Care Bears are unavoidable, so they just try to make the fairings sturdy and hope for a glancing impact.			2018	12	19
2088	Schwarzschild's Cat	schwarzschilds_cat.png	Cats can be smaller than the critical limit, but they're unobservable. If one shrinks enough that it crosses the limit, it just appears to get cuter and cuter as it slowly fades from view.			2018	12	21
2089	Christmas Eve Eve	christmas_eve_eve.png	It turns out that saying "Oh, so THAT'S why they call it Boxing Day" is a good way to get punched a second time.			2018	12	24
2090	Feathered Dinosaur Venn Diagram	feathered_dinosaur_venn_diagram.png	My pet theory is that in real life, the kid at the beginning of Jurassic Park who made fun of the 'six-foot turkey' never got a talking-to from Dr. Grant, and grew up to produce several of the movie's sequels.			2018	12	26
2091	Million, Billion, Trillion	million_billion_trillion.png	You can tell most people don’t really assign an absolute meaning to these numbers because in some places and time periods, “billion” has meant 1,000x what it's meant in others, and a lot of us never even noticed.			2018	12	28
2092	Consensus New Year	consensus_new_year.png	The biggest jump is at 11:00am EST (4:00pm UTC) when midnight reaches the UTC+8 time zone. That time zone, which includes China, is home to a quarter of the world's population. India and Sri Lanka (UTC+5:30) put us over the 50% mark soon after.			2018	12	31
2093	Reminders	reminders.png	The good news is that if the number of work and friend relationships you have exceeds your willingness to do the bare minimum to keep up with everyone's life events and stuff, one way or another that problem eventually solves itself.			2019	1	2
2094	Short Selling	short_selling.png	"I'm selling all my analogies at auction tomorrow, and that witch over there will give you 20 beans if you promise on pain of death to win them for her." "What if SEVERAL people promised witches they'd win, creating some kind of a ... squeeze? Gosh, you could make a lot of–" "Don't be silly! That probably never happens."			2019	1	4
2095	Marsiforming	marsiforming.png	It has so many advantages--it preserves Martian life, requires fewer interplanetary launches, and makes it much easier to field-test Mars rovers.			2019	1	7
2096	Mattresses	mattresses.png	After reading that "The War To Sell You A Mattress Is An Internet Nightmare" article, I've decided it's safer and less complicated to just sleep on the floor. DISCLOSURE: THE AUTHOR OF THIS MOUSEOVER TEXT RECEIVED FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FROM THE FLOOR INDUSTRY FOR THIS MESSAGE.			2019	1	9
2097	Thor Tools	thor_tools.png	CORRECTION: After careful evaluation, we have determined that the axis label on this chart was printed backward.			2019	1	11
2098	Magnetic Pole	magnetic_pole.png	People keep trying to come up with reasons that we should worry about the magnetic field collapsing or reversing, but honestly I think it's fine. Whatever minor problems it causes will be made up for by the mid-latitude auroras.			2019	1	14
2099	Missal of Silos	missal_of_silos.png	Welcome to Wyoming, motto "We'd like to clarify that Cheyenne Mountain is in Colorado."			2019	1	16
2100	Models of the Atom	models_of_the_atom.png	J.J. Thompson won a Nobel Prize for his work in electricity in gases, but was unfairly passed over for his "An atom is plum pudding, and plum pudding is MADE of atoms! Duuuuude." theory.			2019	1	18
2101	Technical Analysis	technical_analysis.png	"I [suspect] that we are throwing more and more of our resources, including the cream of our youth, into financial activities remote from the production of goods and services, into activities that generate high private rewards disproportionate to their social productivity. I suspect that the immense power of the computer is being harnessed to this 'paper economy', not to do the same transactions more economically but to balloon the quantity and variety of financial exchanges." --James Tobin, July 1984			2019	1	21
2102	Internet Archive	internet_archive.png	The fact that things like the npm left-pad incident are so rare is oddly reassuring.			2019	1	23
2103	Midcontinent Rift System	midcontinent_rift_system.png	The best wedge issue is an actual wedge.			2019	1	25
2104	Biff Tannen	biff_tannen.png	I can't help myself; now I want to read a bunch of thinkpieces from newspapers in Biff's 1985 arguing over whether the growth of the region into a corporate dystopia was inevitable.			2019	1	28
2105	Modern OSI Model	modern_osi_model.png	In retrospect, I shouldn't have used each layer of the OSI model as one of my horcruxes.			2019	1	30
2106	Sharing Options	sharing_options.png	How about posts that are public, but every time a company accesses a bunch of them, the API makes their CEO's account click 'like' on one of them at random so you get a notification.			2019	2	1
2107	Launch Risk	launch_risk.png	Don't worry--you're less likely to die from a space launch than from a shark attack. The survival rate is pretty high for both!			2019	2	4
2108	Carbonated Beverage Language Map	carbonated_beverage_language_map.png	There's one person in Missouri who says "carbo bev" who the entire rest of the country HATES.			2019	2	6
2109	Invisible Formatting	invisible_formatting.png	To avoid errors like this, we render all text and pipe it through OCR before processing, fixing a handful of irregular bugs by burying them beneath a smooth, uniform layer of bugs.			2019	2	8

2112	Night Shift	night_shift.png	Help, I set my white balance wrong and suddenly everyone is screaming at each other about whether they've been to Colorado.			2019	2	15
2113	Physics Suppression	physics_suppression.png	If physics had a mafia, I'm pretty sure the BICEP2 mess would have ended in bloodshed.			2019	2	18
2114	Launch Conditions	launch_conditions.png	Though I do think the tiny vent on one of the boosters labeled "O-RING" is in poor taste.			2019	2	20
2115	Plutonium	plutonium.png	It's like someone briefly joined the team running the universe, introduced their idea for a cool mechanic, then left, and now everyone is stuck pretending that this wildly unbalanced dynamic makes sense.			2019	2	22
2116	.NORM Normal File Format	norm_normal_file_format.png	At some point, compression becomes an  aesthetic design choice. Luckily, SVG is a really flexible format, so there's no reason it can't support vector JPEG artifacts.	https://twitter.com/openelex/status/853977391747801088		2019	2	25
2117	Differentiation and Integration	differentiation_and_integration.png	"Symbolic integration" is when you theatrically go through the motions of finding integrals, but the actual result you get doesn't matter because it's purely symbolic.			2019	2	27
