3005	Disposal	disposal.png	We were disappointed that the rocket didn't make a THOOOONK noise when it went into the tube, but we're setting up big loudspeakers for future launches to add the sound effect.			2024	10	30
3006	Demons	demons.png	Though they do appreciate how much he improved the heating system for the flame pit.			2024	11	1
3007	Probabilistic Uncertainty	probabilistic_uncertainty.png	"One popular strategy is to enter an emotional spiral. Could that be the right approach? We contacted several researchers who are experts in emotional spirals to ask them, but none of them were in a state to speak with us."			2024	11	4
3008	Proterozoic Rocks	proterozoic_rocks.png	These rocks are from a time before eyes, brains, and bones, pieces of a land warmed by an unseen sun.			2024	11	6
3009	Number Shortage	number_shortage.png	"10 minutes ago we were down to only 2 0s!" "How many do we have now?" "I ... don't know!!"			2024	11	8

3015	D&D Combinatorics	dnd_combinatorics.png	Look, you can't complain about this after giving us so many scenarios involving N locked chests and M unlabeled keys.			2024	11	22
3016	Cold Air	cold_air.png	We also should really have checked that the old water tower was disconnected from the water system before we started filling it with compressed air.			2024	11	25
3017	Neutrino Modem	neutrino_modem.png	Our sysadmin accidentally won a Nobel Prize while trying to debug neutrino oscillation error correction.			2024	11	27
3018	Second Stage	second_stage.png	Hmm, they won't do in-flight delivery, so let's order a new first and second stage to our emergency landing site and then try to touch down on top of them to save time.			2024	11	29
3019	Advent Calendar Advent Calendar	advent_calendar_advent_calendar.png	The growth rate of items per day may may seem absurd, but it's actually much less than the acceleration in the 12 Days of Christmas song.			2024	12	2

3022	Making Tea	making_tea.png	No, of course we don't microwave the mug WITH the teabag in it. We microwave the teabag separately.			2024	12	9
3023	The Maritime Approximation	the_maritime_approximation.png	It works because a nautical mile is based on a degree of latitude, and the Earth (e) is a circle.			2024	12	11
3024	METAR	metar.png	In the aviation world, they don't use AM/PM times. Instead, all times are assumed to be AM unless they're labeled NOTAM.			2024	12	13
3025	Phase Change	phase_change.png	Even when you try to make nice, smooth ice cubes in a freezer, sometimes one of them will shoot out a random ice spike, which physicists ascribe to kiki conservation.			2024	12	16
3026	Linear Sort	linear_sort.png	The best case is O(n), and the worst case is that someone checks why.			2024	12	18
3027	Exclusion Principle	exclusion_principle.png	Fermions are weird about each other in a standoffish way. Integer-spin particles are weird about each other in a 'stand uncomfortably close while talking' kind of way.			2024	12	20
3028	D&D Roll	dnd_roll.png	Under some circumstances, if you throw a D8 and then a D12 at an enemy, thanks to the D8's greater pointiness you actually have to roll a D12 and D8 respectively to determine damage.			2024	12	23
3029	Sun Avoidance	sun_avoidance.png	C'mon, ESA Solar Orbiter team, just give the Parker probe a LITTLE nudge at aphelion. Crash it into the sun. Fulfill the dream of Icarus. It is your destiny.			2024	12	25
3030	Lasering Incidents	lasering_incidents.png	I still don't know how the police found my compound where I ran an illegal searchlight depot/covert blimp airfield/fireworks testing range.			2024	12	27
3031	Time Capsule Instructions	time_capsule_instructions.png	Inside is a third box, labeled DO NOT OPEN UNLESS YOU ARE IN THE TIME ZONE WHERE YOU OPENED BOTH PREVIOUS BOXES.			2024	12	30
3032	Skew-T Log-P	skew_t_log_p.png	The most important quantity for meteorologists is of course the product of latent pressure and temperostrophic enthalpy, though 'how nice the weather is' is a close second.			2025	1	1
3033	Origami Black Hole	origami_black_hole.png	You may notice the first half of these instructions are similar to the instructions for a working nuclear fusion device. After the first few dozen steps, be sure to press down firmly and fold quickly to overcome fusion pressure.			2025	1	3
3034	Features of Adulthood	features_of_adulthood.png	I don't dig pit traps and cover them with sticks and a thin layer of leaves nearly as much as I expected; I find a chance to do it barely once a month.			2025	1	6
3035	Trimix	trimix.png	You don't want the nitrogen percentage to be too high or you run the risk of eutrophication.			2025	1	8

3038	Uncanceled Units	uncanceled_units.png	Speed limit c arcminutes^2 per steradian			2025	1	15
3039	Human Altitude	human_altitude.png	I wonder what surviving human held the record before balloons (excluding edge cases like jumping gaps on a mountain bridge).

3045	AlphaMove	alphamove.png	It struggles a little with complex positions, like when there are an even number of moves and it has to round down, but when run against itself it's capable of finding some novelties. At one point I saw six knights on the board at once; Stockfish rarely exceeds four.			2025	1	31
3046	Stromatolites	stromatolites.png	If only my ancestors had been fortunate enough to marry into the branch of the bacteria family that could photosynthesize, like all my little green cousins here.			2025	2	3
3047	Rotary Tool	rotary_tool.png	It was great until my thumb slipped and I accidentally launched my telescope into the air at Mach 8.			2025	2	5
3048	Suspension Bridge	suspension_bridge.png	As a first step, they can put in a secondary deck, to help drivers try it out and find out how fun the jumps are. After a while no one will use the old flat deck and they can remove it.			2025	2	7

3050	Atom	atom.png	What's weirder is that muons turned out to be INCREDIBLY cute.			2025	2	12
3051	Hardwood	hardwood.png	They may technically have been softwoods at some point, but they definitely aren't now.			2025	2	14
3052	Archive Request	archive_request.png	They just want researchers in the enclosure to feel enriched and stimulated. ('The Enclosure' is what archivists call the shadowy world outside their archives in which so many people are trapped.)			2025	2	17
3053	KM3NeT	km3net.png	Unfortunately, KM3NeT led to the discovery of the Pauli anglerfish, which emits Cherenkov radiation to prey on neutrino researchers.			2025	2	19
3054	Scream Cipher	scream_cipher.png	AAAAAA A ÃA̧AȂA̦ ǍÅÂÃĀÁȂ AAAAAAA!			2025	2	21

3063	Planet Definitions	planet_definitions.png	Under the 'has cleared its orbital neighborhood' and 'fuses hydrogen into helium' definitions, thanks to human activities Earth technically no longer qualifies as a planet but DOES count as a star.			2025	3	14
3064	Lungfish	lungfish.png	I know having so many base pairs makes rebasing complicated, but you're in Bilateria, so shouldn't you at LEAST be better at using git head?			2025	3	17
3065	Square Units	square_units.png	The biggest I've seen in a published source in the wild is an 80-fold error in a reported distance, which I think came from a series of at least three unit conversions and area/length misinterpretations.			2025	3	19
3066	Cosmic Distance Calibration	cosmic_distance_calibration.png	This is the biggest breakthrough since astronomers noticed that the little crosshairs around red giant stars starting to burn helium are all the same size.			2025	3	21
3067	SawStart	sawstart.png	Unfortunately, SawStart is one-use-only. Once started, the blade cannot be stopped, and must be replaced with a fresh blade while the running one is carefully disposed of.			2025	3	24
3068	Rock Identification	rock_identification.png	'Is it worth anything?' 'I dunno, is the answer to that question worth another $5?'			2025	3	26
3069	Terror Bird	terror_bird.png	There has long been debate about Big Bird's species, with some experts claiming he was a canary, but recent genetic analysis places him firmly in Cariamiformes.			2025	3	28
3070	Orogeny	orogeny.png	Most properties can only boast INDOOR heated floors.			2025	3	31
3071	Decay Chain	decay_chain.png	If you have an old phone in a drawer, and you listen very carefully, you can occasionally hear the occasional tap of an emitted SIM card hitting the side of the drawer as the phone transmutes to a lower-end model.			2025	4	2
3072	Stargazing 4	stargazing_4.png	We haven't actually seen a star fall in since we invented telescopes, but I have a list of ones I'm really hoping are next.			2025	4	4
3073	Tariffs	tariffs.png	[later] I don't get why our pizza slices have such terrible reviews; the geotextile-infused sauce gives the toppings incredible slope stability!			2025	4	7
3074	Push Notifications	push_notifications.png	NOTIFICATION: Now dismissing a head of the Notification Hydra… NOTIFICATION: Success! You have dismissed a head of the Notification Hydra!

3075	Anachronym Challenge	anachronym_challenge.png	I have to pay with paper money.			2025	4	11
3076	The Roads Both Taken	the_roads_both_taken.png	When you worry that you're missing out on something by not making both choices simultaneously by quantum superposition, that's called phomo.			2025	4	14
3077	de Sitter	de_sitter.png	Our anti-de Sitter club is small at the moment, but I've started corresponding with the conformal field theory people.			2025	4	16
3078	Anchor Bolts	anchor_bolts.png	The biggest expense was installing the mantle ducts to keep the carbonate-silicate cycle operating.			2025	4	18
3079	Air Fact	air_fact.png	'Wow, that must be why you swallow so many of them per year!' 'No, that's spiders. You swallow WAY more ants.'			2025	4	21
3080	Tennis Balls	tennis_balls.png	After initial tests created a series of large holes in the wall of the lab, the higher-power Scanning Tunneling Tennis Ball Microscope project was quickly shut down.			2025	4	23
3081	PhD Timeline	phd_timeline.png	Rümeysa Öztürk was grabbed off the street in my town one month ago.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyypeEEOklM		2025	4	25
3082	Chess Position	chess_position.png	It's important to learn the moves that take you into the vortex, but it's best not to study vortex itself too closely. Even grandmasters who have built up a tolerance lose the ability to play for a few hours after studying it.			2025	4	28
3083	Jupiter Core	jupiter_core.png	Juno mission data suggests that Jupiter actually contains Matryoshka doll-style nested copies of every other planet in the Solar System.			2025	4	30

3085	About 20 Pounds	about_20_pounds.png	In addition to gravity, burritos interact through the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, which is believed to be a major contributor to their popularity.			2025	5	5
3086	Globe Safety	globe_safety.png	Frankly, given their extreme gravitational fields and general instability, even 12-inch globes should probably be banned.			2025	5	7
3087	Pascal's Law	pascals_law.png	Reductio ad absurdum fails when reality is absurd.			2025	5	9
3088	Deposition	deposition.png	P.S. If you have time travel, come to my birthday party Saturday!			2025	5	12
3089	Modern	modern.png	Scholars are still debating whether the current period is post-postmodern or neo-contemporary.			2025	5	14
3090	Sail Physics	sail_physics.png	Turning in other directions can be accomplished by using a magnetized centerboard and ocean currents, since a current flowing through a magnetic field induces a Laplace force.			2025	5	16
3091	Renormalization	renormalization.png	Applying renormalization to bullies successfully transformed Pete & Pete's Endless Mike into Finite Mike.			2025	5	19

3095	Archaea	archaea.png	Under the two-domain system, anyone who punches you is technically an Archaean pathogen.			2025	5	28
3096	Check Engine	check_engine.png	They say it's probably safe to keep orbiting for a while, but if it stays on or starts flashing we might have to call someone.			2025	5	30
3097	Bridge Types	bridge_types.png	Pontoon bridges are just linear open-sided waterbeds.			2025	6	2
3098	Trojan Horse	trojan_horse.png	Ultimately, history would imperfectly record the story of the Foal of Troy.			2025	6	4
