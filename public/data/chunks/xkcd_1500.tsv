1832	Photo Library Management	photo_library_management.png	A good lifehack is to use messy and unstable systems to organize your photos. That way, every five years or so it becomes obsolete and/or collapses, and you have to open it up and pick only your favorite pictures to salvage.			2017	5	3

1842	Anti-Drone Eagles	anti_drone_eagles.png	It's cool, it's totally ethical--they're all programmed to hunt whichever bird of prey is most numerous at the moment, so they leave the endangered ones alone until near the end.			2017	5	26
1843	Opening Crawl	opening_crawl.png	Using a classic Timothy Zahn EU/Legends novel is bad enough, but at least the style and setting aren't too far off. If you really want to mess with people, try using Splinter of the Mind's Eye.			2017	5	29
1844	Voting Systems	voting_systems.png	Kenneth Arrow hated me because the ordering of my preferences changes based on which voting systems have what level of support. But it tells me a lot about the people I'm going to be voting with!			2017	5	31

1849	Decades	decades.png	In the 90s, our variety radio station used the tagline "the best music of the 70s, 80s, and 90s." After 2000, they switched to "the best music of the 80s, 90s, and today." I figured they'd change again in 2010, but it's 2017 and they're still saying "80s, 90s, and today." I hope radio survives long enough for us to find out how they deal with the 2020s.			2017	6	12
1850	Air Force Museum	air_force_museum.png	I had fun visiting the museum at Dover Air Force Base, unless they don't have a museum, in which case I've never been to Delaware in my life.			2017	6	14
1851	Magnetohydrodynamics	magnetohydrodynamics.png	Magnetohydrodynamics combines the intuitive nature of Maxwell's equations with the easy solvability of the Navier-Stokes equations. It's so straightforward physicists add "relativistic" or "quantum" just to keep it from getting boring.			2017	6	16

1858	4th of July	4th_of_july.png	Strangely, they still celebrate by eating hot dogs. Since they don't have mouths, they just kinda toss them in the air and let them fall back down into their propeller blades. It's pretty messy.			2017	7	3
1859	Sports Knowledge	sports_knowledge.png	I heard they might make the wild card game, which would be cool. Do you know when that is? I have a wedding next weekend, but if it's after that we could try to go!			2017	7	5
1860	Communicating	communicating.png	You're saying that the responsibility for avoiding miscommunication lies entirely with the listener, not the speaker, which explains why you haven't been able to convince anyone to help you down from that wall.			2017	7	7

1863	Screenshots	screenshots.png	For the final exam, you take a screenshot showing off all the work you've done in the class, and it has to survive being uploaded, thumbnailed, and re-screenshotted through a chain of social media sites.			2017	7	14
1864	City Nicknames	city_nicknames.png	This place has so many demonyms. Northlanders. Fair Folk. Honey Barons. Lake Dwellers. Treasurers. Swamp Watchers. Dream Farmers. Wellfolk. Rockeaters. Forgotten Royals. Remote Clients. Barrow-Clerks. The People of Land and Sky.			2017	7	17
1865	Wifi vs Cellular	wifi_vs_cellular.png	According to the cable company reps who keep calling me, it's because I haven't upgraded to the XTREME GIGABAND PANAMAX FLAVOR-BLASTED PRO PACKAGE WITH HBO, which is only $5 more per month for the first 6 months and five billion dollars per month after that.			2017	7	19
1866	Russell's Teapot	russells_teapot.png	Unfortunately, NASA regulations state that Bertrand Russell-related payloads can only be launched within launch vehicles which do not launch themselves.			2017	7	21

1870	Emoji Movie Reviews	emoji_movie_reviews.png	There's this idea that emoji are bad for communication because they replace ambiguity and nuance with a limited set of preselected emotions, but it doesn't really survive a collision with real-world usage of the thinking face or upside-down smiley.			2017	7	31
1871	Bun Alert	bun_alert.png	Since buns range from crepuscular to nocturnal, it's recommended that you enable the scheduled "Do Not Disturb" mode on your phone to avoid being woken by alerts about Night Buns.			2017	8	2

1876	Eclipse Searches	eclipse_searches.png	There were traffic jams for the eclipses in 1970 and 1979, and that was *before* we had the potential for overnight viral social media frenzies.			2017	8	14
1877	Eclipse Science	eclipse_science.png	I was thinking of observing stars to verify Einstein's theory of relativity again, but I gotta say, that thing is looking pretty solid at this point.			2017	8	16
1878	Earth Orbital Diagram	earth_orbital_diagram.png	You shouldn't look directly at a partial eclipse because of the damage that can be caused by improperly aligning the solar-lunar orbital plane with the orbital bones around your eye.			2017	8	18

1882	Color Models	color_models.png	What if what *I* see as blue, *you* see as a slightly different blue because you're using Chrome instead of Firefox and despite a decade of messing with profiles we STILL can't get this right somehow.			2017	8	28
1883	Supervillain Plan	supervillain_plan.png	Someday, some big historical event will happen during the DST changeover, and all the tick-tock articles chronicling how it unfolded will have to include a really annoying explanation next to their timelines.			2017	8	30
1884	Ringer Volume/Media Volume	ringer_volume_media_volume.png	Our new video ad campaign has our product's name shouted in the first 500 milliseconds, so we can reach the people in adjacent rooms while the viewer is still turning down the volume.			2017	9	1
1885	Ensemble Model	ensemble_model.png	I'm in talks with Netflix to produce an alternate-universe crime drama about the world where sliced bread was never re-legalized, but it's going slowly because they keep changing their phone numbers and the door lock codes at their headquarters.			2017	9	4
1886	Typing Notifications	typing_notifications.png	Over the years I've decided I'd rather have them on than not, but I'm glad there aren't "has opened a blank note to compose a reply to you" notifications.			2017	9	6
1887	Two Down, One to Go	two_down_one_to_go.png	The third row will probably have to wait until 2034, and maybe longer. If I see a daytime supernova, I'll replace the meteor storm with that and consider it 3/3.			2017	9	8
1888	Still in Use	still_in_use.png	'Which one?' 'I dunno, it's your house. Just check each object.' 'Check it for *what*?'

1891	Obsolete Technology	obsolete_technology.png	And I can't believe some places still use fax machines. The electrical signals waste so much time going AROUND the Earth when neutrino beams can go straight through!			2017	9	18
1892	USB Cables	usb_cables.png	Tag yourself, I'm "frayed."			2017	9	20
1893	Thread	thread.png	Since the current Twitter threadfall kicked off in early 2016, we can expect it to continue until the mid 2060s when the next Interval begins.			2017	9	22
1894	Real Estate	real_estate.png	I tried converting the prices into pizzas, to put it in more familiar terms, and it just became a hard-to-think-about number of pizzas.			2017	9	25

1901	Logical	logical.png	It's like I've always said--people just need more common sense. But not the kind of common sense that lets them figure out that they're being condescended to by someone who thinks they're stupid, because then I'll be in trouble.			2017	10	11
1902	State Borders	state_borders.png	A schism between the pro-panhandle and anti-panhandle factions eventually led to war, but both sides spent too much time working on their flag designs to actually do much fighting.			2017	10	13

1905	Cast Iron Pan	cast_iron_pans.png	If you want to evenly space them, it's easiest to alternate between the Arctic and Antarctic. Some people just go to the Arctic twice, near the equinoxes so the visits are almost 6 months apart, but it's not the same.			2017	10	20
1906	Making Progress	making_progress.png	I started off with countless problems. But now I know, thanks to COUNT(), that I have "#REF! ERROR: Circular dependency detected" problems.			2017	10	23

1911	Defensive Profile	defensive_profile.png	NO DRAMA ZONE -> If I've made you sad, you'd better not tell me, because I am TERRIFIED of that situation and have NO IDEA how to handle it.			2017	11	3
